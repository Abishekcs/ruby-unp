ruby-unp is a learning project that reimplements examples from “**UNIX Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API**” by W. Richard Stevens, Bill Fenner, and Andrew M. Rudoff in both C and Ruby.

The goal is to understand how fundamental UNIX networking concepts like sockets, TCP/UDP, and client-server models translate from C’s low-level APIs to Ruby’s higher-level abstractions.
